## Thank you
First of all, thanks for contribution. We really appreciate your time to make Khome better.

## Conventional commits
Khome uses Conventional Commits. This [specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

Check out these [examples](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples) if you wish.

### Why we use Conventional Commits
- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates adn the public.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for you to contribute to our project, by allowing you to explore a more structured commit history.
